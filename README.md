# Introduction

This guide aims to be a new community resource for Unreal Engine 4. The first initiative behind this guide is to find and preserve as much of the original Unreal Engine 4 Wiki as possible. In addition to preserving the original wiki content, we're also planning on publishing new and updated content that may be useful to the Unreal development community. This can be seen with the new "Quick Reference" section.
